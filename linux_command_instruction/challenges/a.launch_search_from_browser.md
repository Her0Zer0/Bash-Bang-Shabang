### Challenge
Launch a search from the terminal for vscode. 

1. Look at the manual for the **firefox** command. 

```.sh
$ man firefox
```

2. Inside the manual, look for something to help you with searching common text. In our case, it is actually named **-search**. 
The manual states, **"Search for term with your default search engine"**. 
    -   Press **q** to quit the manual. 

3. Launch the firefox with the search term **vscode**
```.sh
$ firefox -search "vscode"
```

How did you do? Hopefully that went well, but if it didn't, don't worry because we have more to go through together. These challenges are just meant to use a little of something we have used so far and peak your interest of how to become a good slooth or detective on how to find the information you need when you need it.
