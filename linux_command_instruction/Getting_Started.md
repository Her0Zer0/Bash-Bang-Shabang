# Prerequisites for getting started:

* Linux Distro (preferably  Debian based for these examples because we will be using Lubuntu for the tutorial)
* sudo or root privileges on the account
* Access to a terminal window/command line (Ctrl-Alt-T, Ctrl-Alt-F2)

To get started you will need the environment in which you wish to work with.  For my environment, I have chosen Lubuntu.  You can set this up on your desktop/laptop either as dual boot windows/linux or as a virtual machine. Some popular virtual machines are: 

    *   Virtual Box: 
            https://www.virtualbox.org/
    
    *   Boxes: 
            https://help.gnome.org/users/gnome-boxes/stable/

After you have your linux distro up and running, find a terminal and begin to the next section.
