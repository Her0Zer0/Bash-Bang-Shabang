## Basic Searching

Searching tools are some of the most useful with the terminal because of the obviously limited graphical display, and if used properly can save you lots of time versus using a gui. 

Some of the tools we are going to talk explicitly about here are

* locate ( or in some instances now, **mlocate** )
* find
* which
* grep
